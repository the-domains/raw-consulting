            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bringing Emerging Technology to Life</h1><p>We designed and built the EVOKE Lab at UC-Irvine's School of Information and Computer Science to serve as a campus hub for students and faculty to imagine and realize next-generation interfaces and experiences with technology. Bringing together advanced tools for building - microprocessors, 3D printing and other fabrication, gestural and immersive computing technologies - with deep social science theory and design methodologies, we created a space visited and used by groups throughout the campus to collaborate (3D Printing Club, Dance Department, TEDxUCI, Informatics, Anthropology, and many others.) </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/efdc4e0b16d0b7374c2443e04b2ce4e859f60f1e.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Showcasing the ISTC•Social</h1><p>Teams from Cornell, Georgia Tech, Indiana, NYU, UC-Irvine, and Intel Labs have tackled a broad array of topics where society and technology meet, such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, new paradigms for information and data privacy, mobile health and the quantified self, emerging styles of work and labor, critical design practices and theories, digital identity throughout and beyond the human life cycle, civic participation, the DIY and maker movements, technological obsolescence and repurposing, and the ways that algorithmic regimes scaffold human activity in increasingly opaque and subtle ways.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7acedbf791d4e1200c959be94ed6f10b694f218c.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Data-Intensive Science and Campus IT</h1><p>Montana State University developed the Research Data Census to engage local research communities in dialogue about their data: size, sharing of resources, sharing behaviors, and interest in data-related services. The census confirmed the need for a tight coupling of IT infrastructure to data and curation services in order to make those resources useful to the research community.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7a86c6a14a2f01226a11b943bcb1da715975f438.jpg"></article>]]></description>
