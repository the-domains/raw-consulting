# Bringing Emerging Technology to Life

We designed and built the EVOKE Lab at UC-Irvine's School of Information and Computer Science to serve as a campus hub for students and faculty to imagine and realize next-generation interfaces and experiences with technology. Bringing together advanced tools for building - microprocessors, 3D printing and other fabrication, gestural and immersive computing technologies - with deep social science theory and design methodologies, we created a space visited and used by groups throughout the campus to collaborate (3D Printing Club, Dance Department, TEDxUCI, Informatics, Anthropology, and many others.)
