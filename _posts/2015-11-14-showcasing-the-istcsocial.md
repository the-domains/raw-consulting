# Showcasing the ISTC•Social

At the conclusion of a three-year collaboration between Intel Labs and five respected research institutions (Cornell, Georgia Tech, Indiana, NYU, and University of California-Irvine), the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing (ISTC•Social) faced the task of collecting and presenting the research of a community of over 100 scholars and students to present to the public. Spanning a broad range of research topics and sites, as well as a robust and varied portfolio of artifacts and products, RAW Consulting was engaged to collect, organize, archive, create standard metadata, and develop an accessible taxonomy for the collection. In addition, RAW was tasked with designing and implementing the website that serves as the ongoing public record of the ISTC•Social project after its conclusion. Working with Intel and academy project managers, we deployed the website in May 2015 with an unveiling at Intel Labs in Hillsboro, OR.
