# About David Casti, Lead Consultant

David Casti is a business and technical leader with a long track record of success working with organizations of all sizes. As an early Internet trailblazer, Mr. Casti participated in the creation of key information technologies that businesses depend upon every day.

As a Vice President of DIGEX, he oversaw the successful acquisition of DIGEX by Intermedia, where Mr. Casti remained a member of the executive team.
