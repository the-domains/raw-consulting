Cory holds a Ph.D. in Information from the University of Michigan, with additional graduate degrees and training in statistics, information economics and policy, human-computer interaction, science & technology studies, and complex systems. Before founding RAW Consulting, Dr. Knobel was a professor of Information & Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, and then University of California, Irvine. At UC-Irvine, he designed, built, and was the Executive Director of the [EVOKE Lab & Studio][0], which pursued emerging technology research and design in service of social engagement and transformation. Cory's advanced training in data and information science, statistical analysis, social network analysis, mathematical modeling, and complex systems brings the rigor of hard numbers and data to his insights. His additional expertise in ethnographic and interview methods, content and conversational analysis, organizational theory, and social analysis of science and technology give robustness and deep context to the meaning behind the numbers.
