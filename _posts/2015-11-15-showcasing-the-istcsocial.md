description: 'Teams from Cornell, Georgia Tech, Indiana, NYU, UC-Irvine, and Intel Labs have tackled a broad array of topics where society and technology meet, such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, new paradigms for information and data privacy, mobile health and the quantified self, emerging styles of work and labor, critical design practices and theories, digital identity throughout and beyond the human life cycle, civic participation, the DIY and maker movements, technological obsolescence and repurposing, and the ways that algorithmic regimes scaffold human activity in increasingly opaque and subtle ways.'

# Showcasing the ISTC•Social

At the conclusion of a three-year collaboration between Intel Labs and five respected research universities (Cornell, Georgia Tech, Indiana, NYU, and University of California-Irvine), the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing (ISTC•Social) faced the task of collecting and presenting the research of a community of over 100 scholars and students to present to the public. Spanning a broad range of research topics and sites, as well as a robust and varied portfolio of artifacts and products, RAW Consulting was engaged to collect, organize, archive, create standard metadata, and develop an accessible taxonomy for the collection. In addition, RAW was tasked with designing and implementing the website that serves as the ongoing public record of the ISTC•Social project after its conclusion. Working with Intel and academy project managers,we deployed the website in May 2015 with an unveiling at Intel Labs in Hillsboro, OR. The ISTC•Social site can be viewed at [http://istcsocial.gatech.edu][0].
